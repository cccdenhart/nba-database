# NBA Database - Spring 2018
This is a Java application that implements CRUD operations via MySql.  These operations allow one to view NBA player statistics and alter lineups as a manager would do. 

Data was collected from [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/) and preprocessed in R.

This was a final project for *CS3200: Database Design*, completed during Spring 2018.
